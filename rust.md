_problems with rust_

## Why rust?

>Featuring

>zero-cost abstractions

>move semantics
guaranteed memory safety

>threads without data races

>trait-based generics

>pattern matching

>type inference

>minimal runtime

>efficient C bindings

Just some main features from the [rust-lang website](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/index.html). Have not used Rust in any projects myself, do not think I could give it a relevant comment. 

Some other points from `Why Rust` the free e-book

>No null pointer dereferences. Programs wonâ€™t crash because you forgot to check whether a pointer was null.

>No dangling pointers, no leaks. Every value will live as long as it must, and no longer.

>No buffer overruns. Your program will never access elements beyond the end or before the start of an array.

Seems it really much **safer** than C++ to some extend.

Hoping I can dive more into this problem in the future.
