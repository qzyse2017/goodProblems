collect problrm about typescript

## where to get detailed documentation?
I found [the offical documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs) mainly talks about features on which typescript different from javascript and some best practise.  
So where to find the more detailed version which describes the methods of a specific type or class? As the previous documentation described, typescript is a superset implementation of syntax described in [ECMAScript 2015](http://es6-features.org/), so its documentation may help.  
Also, many basic types in typescript are similar to javascript so [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) may be good choice.
