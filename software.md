## Some good methods about building SAAS software
See the posts from docker's documentation, introduction about its goal from its home page   
> The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:  
> Use declarative formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;   
> Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system, offering maximum portability between execution environments;  
> Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;  
> Minimize divergence between development and production, enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility;  
> And can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.  
> The twelve-factor methodology can be applied to apps written in any programming language, and which use any combination of backing services (database, queue, memory cache, etc).
