hoping I will learn some in the future `: )`


## Display device
1. Better settings for display to let lights from screen feels softer
use night light settings to decrease blue light in night.  
steps:  
Start  > Settings  > System > Display > Night light > Night light settings.

Also tried another method which maps colors with more white to those much darker, but it seeems not to work well in night, lights from the screen still feels strong. Use high contrast mode.  
steps:  
Type "high contrast settings" in the search box -> select High contrast settings from the list of results
-> Under Choose a theme -> select a high contrast theme from the drop-down menu -> select Apply.
You need to choose proper color to let the screen feels softer here.
