list some problems I encountered while using CSS(cascading style sheets)

## Some best practise for writing CSS

Just learned CSS myself, do not think rules I listed here will be useful for those who is already skilled, just some basic recommendations.

1. format your CSS code to make it more readable and names and files/directories should be well-named.

2. Use some frameworks to make the developing fast.

3. Use a Reset to ``eliminate browser inconsistencies such as heights, font sizes, margins, headings, etc. The reset allows your layout look consistent in all browsers.`` such as [cleanslate](https://github.com/premasagar/cleanslate).

4. organize the CSS well. Recommend [methods-organize-css](https://css-tricks.com/methods-organize-css), no ideal method to organize CSS in theory, choose a one suitable for your project. 

5. combine elements

6. Create Your HTML First

7. Write comments

8. use ems instead of pixels
