# tool chain
Share simple and convenient tool chains building in developing and some other tools helping work and learn more efficiently.

## drawing tools
- onlien tools
  - ```draw.io```, easy, GUI, free, good combination with github. Authorize this site with your github acount info and you can conveniently save your online works to your github repository.
  - ```https://www.visual-paradigm.com/```
  - ```http://cn-mirrors.com/asciiflow/index.html```
- graphviz. Write scripts to generate pictures, a lot of format of output supported. A little trouble in utf-8 encodings on Windows 10, but works fine in Windows SubSystem Linux and Linux system. Also support python extensions.
- InkScape. Open source software, support multiple format and you can write extensions to make it more powerful.

## codegen tools


## online editor
### tex
- recommended site: ```https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/XeLaTeX```

## RSS Readers
### Newsflow
- strongly recommended for windows 10 users, I use it to track rss feeds and atom feeds. You can also subscribe your github private feeds showed in your homepage. 
- get it by simply searching and installing it in Microsoft Store, it's free and rather user-friendly.
- this app is built with [fluent design](https://fluent.microsoft.com/) ,so its appearance is rather similar to Mail app in windows 10, you can also observe some special effects such as illumination along your mouse's movemovents.
- **Special Use with GitHub**
  - use `https://github.com/UserName-here.atom` ,you can see all activities of a specific person.
  - use `https://github.com/UserName-here/Repository-Name-here/commits/master.atom`, you can keep track of a specific repository's commits and get the newest commits by click the `refresh` button on the top-right corner of the app on this feed's page.
  - subscribe to github's officail blogs by adding `https://blog.github.com/feed.xml`. You can get news post by GitHub's staff team. I bet you will like it if you are a huge fan of GitHub.

## Markdown
### Editor
- vscode with extension `Markdown All in One`
  - It is said to be very handy but I prefer light editors `: )`
- Sublime Text3
  - light, fast and with simple syntax highlighting

### Reader
- Chrome with extension `markdown-viewer` 
  - you can get it in Chrome Web Store 
  - with print function built in Chrome you can simply transfer your `.md` file to `.pdf` file
  - by pressing `F5` or clicking `refresh` button of the browser, you get new preview of your `.md` file after changing it

## Multiline/multi-cursor/multi-selection editing in various editors/IDE
Just list some commands I usually use here, you may get a full list in ref.

vscode:

you may also use ```File > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts. (Code > Preferences > Keyboard Shortcuts on macOS)``` to verify the right key shortcuts in your editor.

> On Windows, you hold ```Ctrl+Alt``` while pressing the up ↑ or down ↓ arrow keys to add cursors.(I just have my screen image reversed on my PC `:)`. On Mac and Linux, the equivalents are ```Opt+ Cmd+↑/↓ ```and ```Shift+Alt+↑/↓```, respectively.

> hold ```Alt and left click``` to place cursors arbitrarily.

Sublime:
```
On Windows, in sublime text 2 , it is ctrl + shift + right mouse click, it may vary if you are use sublime text 3, see the ref afterwards for more detail.
```
